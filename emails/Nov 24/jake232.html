&nbsp; <span style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)"> As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Dorgan earmarked substantial funds to create a Red River Valley Research Corridor to bring new high-tech jobs to that region. The Research Corridor was anchored by North Dakota State University and the University of North Dakota, which became magnets for new economic opportunities and new jobs in materials science, micro and nano-technology research, unmanned aviation vehicle research, among others. Financial Regulation and the Global Financial Crisis As early as 1994, Dorgan was sounding the warning about the speculation in unregulated financial derivatives, which would later be a central issue in the subprime mortgage crisis and subsequent 2007â€“2012 global financial crisis, by U.S. banks on their proprietary accounts. He wrote the cover story for the Washington Monthly magazine titled "Very Risky Business" warning of the danger to the economy of the wagers that large financial institutions were making by trading in unlimited derivatives. In 1999, Dorgan voiced continuing concern over lack of regulation of derivatives. We are moving towards greater risk. We must do something to address the regulation of hedge funds and especially derivatives in this country, $33 trillion, a substantial amount of it held by the 25 largest banks in this country, a substantial amount being traded in proprietary accounts of those banks. That kind of risk overhanging the financial institutions of this country one day, with a thud, will wake everyone up. </span>
