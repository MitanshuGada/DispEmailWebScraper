<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: medium; line-height: 150%">Big Tom,<br><br>In 2007, I was a trainer for the Canadian Forces.<br><br>One day, a new group of recruits came in. The usual bunch: 20-ish, males, not so fit. But this woman stood out.<br><br>A 4 feet 10, 46-years-old Romanian woman with a PhD in anthropology and a last name I couldn't pronounce. She spoke with a thick accent. And promptly failed her fitness test.<br><br>Women had to do 9 push-ups. She did 4. My job was to help her do at least 9. Or else she would be kicked out.<br><br>A few weeks in, I learned she enrolled as a last resort. She couldn't find work in Canada, and needed to help her family back in Romania.<br><br>I'm not sure she knew what to expect. Basic military training is hard, even for men in their 20s. A few don't make it through. But for a women aged 46?<br><br>Training was taking it's toll on her. After a month, she came up to me. I noticed how tired and stressed out she looked. She was about to get tested again. She asked me:<br><br><i>"Do you think I will pass the push-up test?"</i><br><br>I said:<br><br><i>"That depends on who carries out the test. You don't always go all the way down on your push-ups. Your arm has to be at least parallel to the floor, or your push-ups won't count."</i><br><br>Failing the test meant she might get kicked out, fail to find work, and not be able to support her family.<br><br>The day of the test, I was surprised to find out I would be carrying out the test for her. Usually, we didn't test the recruits we trained.<br><br>I tested a few males first. They did well. Her turn came. She nodded and got into position. I counted:<br><br><i>"1, 2, 3, lower..."</i><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: medium; line-height: 150%">"Lower" meant her push-up wasn't low enough, and didn't count. She kept going:<br><br><i>"4, 5, lower, lower..."</i><br><br>She paused at the top and took a deep breath. That was allowed.<br><br><i>"6, 7... lower... lower..."</i><br><br>Another pause.<br><br><i>"8... lower... lower... 9..."</i><br><br>She looked up, surprised. I said: "Keep going!"<br><br>She ended up doing 13 push-ups. We both knew that meant she passed the test. And <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: medium; line-height: 150%">she would be able to move forward in the military and ultimately help her family out.</span><br><br>She got up, crying silently. Of relief, I guessed. She nodded and walked back to her position. There was no talking during tests. Later, when I gave her her report, she said:<br><br><i>"I will pray for you."</i><br><br>I remember it to this day. I don't know how she ended up, but I do know she improved a lot in just one month. In an environment that can break even young men.<br><br>Her secret? I can only guess, but I'd say: dedication. She must have done everything right: training, eating, and recovery.<br><br>Her secret can be yours too. With enough dedication, you can succeed against tough odds. Like this 46-yo Romanian soldier.<br><br>If you're ready to get hard abs, for your nutrition, I recommend intermittent fasting. <a href="https://drmuscleapp.com/abs-challenge.html">I explain why in this video</a>.<br><br>It can help you lose 4-10 lbs in 30 days, which is exactly the time it took this little Romanian soldier to go from 4 to 13 push-ups. If she did it, I'm sure you can.<br><br>Thanks for reading this far.<br><br>Your friend in science-based natural bodybuilding,<br><br>Carl Juneau, PhD<br></span></p>
