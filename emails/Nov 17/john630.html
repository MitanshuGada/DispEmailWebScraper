<div id="mailctn"><div id="mail"><div><p>Hi John,</p>
<p>Can you become a great guitar player if you have no natural talent?</p>
<p>Some say yes, some say no.</p>
<p>Some say that a natural aptitude is absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>Others say that the only thing that matters is how much you practice, so get these 8 hours a day in the bank, day after day.</p>
<p>Now, not to toot my own horn here, but I <em>am</em> someone who makes a living by teaching guitar, and I have a certain (considerable) experience
teaching all kinds of people.</p>
<p>And so in my not-so-humble evidence-based no-really-trust-me-I-have-seen-things-you-people-wouldn't-believe opinion:</p>
<p>... most of the above is just cow poop.</p>
<p>Because becoming a great player is a matter of <em>technology.</em></p>
<p>No, I don't mean you have to use your iPhone. I mean technology in its original meaning as:</p>
<p><em>Technology (noun): the application of scientific knowledge for practical purposes</em></p>
<p>Or, in other words, you need to:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Know how humans improve at guitar playing (or other strictly-timed high-coordination fine motor skills)</p></li>
<li><p>Create practice</p></li>
<li><p>You need to do it.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>That is <em>exactly</em> what we do at events like the Total Guitar Mastery Training Week:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.musictheoryforguitar.com/index.php?option=com_acymailing&amp;ctrl=url&amp;subid=62955&amp;urlid=662&amp;mailid=761">https://tomhess.net/GuitarMastery2024?ai=299&amp;pid=52</a></p>
<p>... or better, by the time we start the Total Guitar Mastery Training Week, we (the trainers) have already gone through points 1 and 2 above.</p>
<p>We will teach you how to do it.</p>
<p>Then we will drill you military-style in the correct practice.</p>
<p>And, believe it or not, both you and us will have a ton of fun in the process. (It's fun to improve, and it's fun for us to see you improving!)</p>
<p>If you're interested, check the link above (but hurry up, we only have so many spots left), otherwise I will see you Monday for another music
theory video on something completely different.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
<p>P.S. A little preview of what we will be teaching at this event (aka: the very same strategies that have enabled people to achieve those insane
gains). That's what I meant by "technology" above:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The “brain sheath” practice method for rewiring bad guitar technique habits as predictably and smoothly as your next inhale and
exhale.</p></li>
<li><p>Fretting finger autonomy training. (The key to making your fingers move independently from each other - giving you greater dexterity,
flexibility, and coordination at higher speeds)</p></li>
<li><p>A simple (but effective) speed burst “twist” that lets you fix mistakes without slowing down. (And do it in mere minutes instead of
weeks or months).</p></li>
<li><p>“Dual Lens” technique training – designed to help you master multiple areas of your guitar technique (and speed) ... using
ANY guitar lick as your exercise.</p></li>
<li><p>3-action synchronization training for keeping your playing clean at top speeds. (Most people think 2-hand sync is about ‘2’
actions. They are wrong. Tom Hess teaches you the ‘3rd’ missing piece to give you maximum gains in speed and accuracy.)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>... and a whole lot more.</p>
