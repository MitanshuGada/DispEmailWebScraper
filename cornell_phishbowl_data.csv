<div></div>

<div>My client specialises in the finance and accountancy space and has an awesome opportunity to build out a desk in one of their core areas (SaaS/FinTech or Creative/Film/TV). You would be working closely with one of the Founders of the business who is looking to double their Boston headcount in the next 18 months for a remote job.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Depending on experience and your ability, basic salaries will range between $7,000 and $10,000 monthly (could be some flex) alongside a strong commission structure. These guys are based in the Seaport district and work 4.5 days a week (Friday finishes at 1pm). It's also worth noting that they're open to different experiences - you don't need to be recruited into the finance/accountancy sectors to fill this position.</div>

<div>The Dimax Centre for Disability Services Council (CDS) is looking to fill a position that would start anytime between now and next week.

This is a very simple job that allows you to learn how to purchase teaching materials for the teachers and students in disability centers.</div>

<div>You will be working with Dr. [First name, Last name] who has just been transferred to Canada which is the reason for this employment opportunity urgency.</div>

<div>You would be trained by Dr. [first name] herself.</div>

<p>From the Office of the Professor<br>
College of Arts &amp; Sciences<br>
Cornell Center for Social Sciences<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
This message is from the office of Professor [Spoofed Name] of the Psychology department. I am an administrative assistant to the professor and have been directed to broadcast this message to announce the department's latest job openings to qualified students interested in working remotely.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Cornell University, Department of Psychology, urgently requires the service of students as research assistants, whose mentoring/teaching and engagement will contribute to our interconnected goals of excellence, diversity, equity, and inclusion. Their roles are to assist in literature searches, data collection and analysis, and manuscript preparation. They will also help design experiments, recruit participants, and manage databases. All this includes eligibility to work remotely and get paid $551.25 weekly.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
This gives excellent opportunities for students to study and earn money, including assigned research work, mentorship, travel funding, and program-based professional development opportunities related to scholarship and teaching to prepare them for possible tenure-track appointments in the Institution for employment or pursuing a Ph.D. Also, the position provides a variety of support activities for students, including networking events, grant writing workshops, and research training. Additionally, the department furnishes tools to help researchers identify potential grant-funding organizations.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
NB. The research position applications are open to all students from any academic department in the Institution. They can be referred to anyone interested in filling this position, and tasks can be done remotely. All this could be achieved without affecting academic performance or leisure time. The job description is with less work time a week, and it is very flexible and won't affect other daily activities. This research project is continually in progress all year round (during fall, summer, or winter), as we are working in partnership with other departments, research, and development educational programs. Therefore, there is no fixed duration for the research project.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
To proceed with the application process and other eligibility descriptions, please get in touch with Professor [Spoofed Name]'s research application number at +1 (###) ###-#### via text message acknowledging your full name, email address, year of study, and department to receive the job description and further application requirements.<br>
Best regards.</p>

This message is from the office of Professor [Spoofed Name] of the Department of Statistics and Data Science. I am an admin assistant to the professor, and I have been directed to broadcast this message to announce the latest job openings at the department to qualified students who are interested in working remotely.</p>

<p>Cornell University, Department of Statistics and Data Science urgently requires the service of students as research assistants, whose mentoring/teaching and engagement will contribute to our interconnected goals of excellence, diversity, equity, and inclusion. They are to work remotely and get paid $500 weekly.<br>
The research position applications are open to students from any academic department, and tasks can be done remotely. It gives excellent opportunities for students to study and earn money, including assigned research work, mentorship, travel funding, and program-based professional development opportunities related to scholarship and teaching to prepare them for possible tenure-track appointments in the Institution.<br>
Also, the position provides a variety of support activities for students, including networking events, grant writing workshops, and research training. Additionally, the department furnishes tools to help researchers identify potential grant-funding organizations.<br>
All this could be achieved without affecting academic performance or leisure time. Tasks can be carried out remotely with less work time a week.</p>

<p><br>
To go ahead with the application process and other eligibility descriptions, please get in touch with Professor [Spoofed Name] at 1(###) ###-#### via text message acknowledging your full name, email address, year of study, and department to receive the job description and further application requirements.</p>

All this includes eligibility to work remotely and get paid <strong>$551.25 weekly</strong>.</p>

They will assist in literature searches, data collection and analysis, and manuscript preparation. They will also help design experiments, recruit participants, and manage databases. They are eligible to work remotely and get paid&nbsp;<b>$551.25 weekly.</b>&nbsp;This gives excellent opportunities for students to study and earn money, including assigned research work, mentorship, travel funding, and program-based professional development opportunities related to scholarship and teaching to prepare them for possible tenure-track appointments in the Institution for employment or pursuing a Ph.D. Also, the position provides a variety of support activities for students, including networking events, grant writing workshops, and research training.
