						He was one of the first people to try a morning ritual that’s currently making the rounds on the Internet.<br>

						In fact, during the time it took you to read this e-mail, another 429 men have just said goodbye to ED forever...<br>

			<p style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)">A dipolar gravity realm was created, which implicates that everything which exist – is present in the two parallel worlds, at one time. The substance from our physical world is characterized by mass, inertia, friction and lack of intelligence/ the one existing in the counter-matter has the inverse features: is weightless, self-mobile, super-slippery and possesses a natural intelligence i.e. capable of thinking in its natural state (where the lines of gravity force converge to one border point: to disappear from our world through some sort of unseen barrier to show up in the separate from ours – parallel world). Tapping to this force gives an immense power (it’s a knowledge about the nature of matter). The Most Important Knowledge You would Ever Read, Implement and Live up to Forever More precisely, it’s a dynamic system of expansion and contraction, bound by its own equilibrium, creating infinite potential within a finite boundary. All set into motion by a central black hole which by force of torque creates a two equal and opposite polarized magnetic fields (positive, negative). Atoms28 are not pushed together, but rather pulled together by the “negative” contracting force of sub-atomic black holes, which is why protons (positive) are attracted to center and electrons (negative) are repelled outward. The resulting convergence of two opposite polar charges creates smaller fields of equilibrium known as neutron particles. The convergence of three separate planes creates the perception of a three dimensional reality.</p>
