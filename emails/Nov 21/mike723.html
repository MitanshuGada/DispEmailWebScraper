That’s the latest buzzword from the data crunchers over at Bumble, who predict singles will be prioritizing emotional intimacy in 2024. In fact, for 32% of singles, it’s shaping up to be even more important than the physical kind.<br><br>As Bumble’s relationship expert observed, <i>“There is less of a scarcity mentality when it comes to dating, which allows people the freedom to show up as their full selves as early as possible to avoid either party wasting time.”</i><br><br>So let’s talk about setting yourself up for success on the apps. Sure, your profile still needs compelling photos and a bio that sheds some light on your hobbies and interests. The basics haven’t changed.<br><br>But start thinking about how to best share your authentic emotional self, and how you can communicate your values, beliefs, and what truly makes you tick.<br><br>Ask yourself: Does my profile reflect who I am at my core? Am I communicating my true values and not just surface-level interests? Remember, it's about attracting someone who resonates with the real you, not just a curated version.<br><br>You can do this by carefully selecting the prompts you want to include in your profile, and curating the badges you want displayed to potential matches.<br><br>Even Tinder is embracing the emotional intimacy movement, announcing just this week they’re rolling out brand new profile prompts and basic info tags. According to a recent user survey, daters prioritize value-based qualities such as respect (78%) and open-mindedness (61%) over looks (56%).<br><br>Make sure your profile is ready to meet the moment, and you’ll be one step closer toward meeting your perfect match.<br><br>Happy swiping,<br><br>Scott<br><br><b>Scott Valdez</b><br>Founder, VIDA<br><a href="https://go.vidaselect.com/c/s/UFI/6pZpw/6/6ddR/u9s/6IULjK/HGmtHTZYv/P/P/pa" title="Link: https://www.vidaselect.com/men">VIDAselect.com</a><br>Instagram: @VIDAselect<br><br>PS - Tackling 'Intuitive Intimacy' in your profile can feel daunting, but it's shaping up to be a crucial skill for daters in 2024.
