<p>Dear Beloved one,</p><p>My name is Mrs. Sophia Alexander from United States of America. I am married to Mr. Anthony Alexander who once worked with our Embassy in Germany in the year 2002 and he also worked in an embassy in London for a period of 16 years before he died.</p><p>
We were married for 25 years without a child before he died after a brief illness. Since his death I decided not to remarry due to my religious belief. When my late husband was alive we deposited the sum of USD$15.000.000.00 (Fifteen million United State American dollars) with a Bank here in America. Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next Four months due to my cancer illness.</p><p>
Having known my condition, I have decided to transfer this money to your account so you will assist Charity organisation, orphanages,pensioners,handicaps, elderly people and widows. l took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit or claim this money from the bank if anything happens to me. </p><p>As soon as I receive your reply, I will also issue a letter of authorisation and ask my bank to transfer the funds to your account. </p><p>
Any delay in your reply may give me room to look for another good person for this same purpose. </p><p>I am waiting to hear from you.</p><p>Thanks<br>Mrs. Sophia</p></div></div></div>
