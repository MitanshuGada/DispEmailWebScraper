<div id="mailctn"><div id="mail"><pre>Greeting,
I'm Kalinin Vladimir. Sorry that my mail came as a surprise to you, i`m 
in search of and in need of someone I can trust for charity. I was 
diagnosed with lung cancer euphoric after which the doctor said I will 
die at any time. I was ill-treated by close associates. I have in mind 
to give the remainder of my money to charity, I want to distribute these 
funds to people in need and less privileged Children. I am old and 
really blessed by fate. I will wait here for an answer before I go ahead 
and inform the bank of my intentions</pre></div></div>
