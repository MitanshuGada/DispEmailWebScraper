									<p>If you have a pair of glasses or sunglasses that last a long time, you know it is because they are made of quality materials. It is not uncommon for cheap sunglasses to break within a week of use. Thankfully, <a href="http://www.drawwhip.best/Jttkormtj/xwvgcra18610tfmbxarxf/V-yv1tGTT-i7iKpnajvGk6B6D8Svmaj5Ga61e7r0RQw/g-VdCMeu15vizGJ90nbBz_-uIM4Gq9hRFNY46dwzi-Y">ClearView</a> glasses are built to be solid.</p>





									<p>The durable metallic allow looks good and is made to last. Combine this with the spring loaded hinges which ensure your comfort and you have a quality product, that looks great.</p>





									<p>The nose pad is professionally made making them comfortable for long periods of use. The soft material really acts as a cushion on your nose to support the glasses. They fit better than most and are stable when in use.</p>





									<p>Despite being made this way, they are also incredibly lightweight. Weighing only 20g they are made with your comfort in mind. The modern yellow color is suitable for both men and women and looks great.</p>
