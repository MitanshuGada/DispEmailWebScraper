<td style="font-family: Gotham, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, &quot;sans-serif&quot;; text-align: left"><p><strong>A SUCCESSFUL INVESTOR</strong><br> Written by Angela Akers<br> November 17, 2023</p> <img width="160" height="196" align="left" alt=""> <p>After last week's indecision and Fed worries, investors were hopeful that this week's inflation data would give the Fed a reason to re-evaluate their hawkish stance and it did. Consumer and Producer Price Inflation came in cooler-than-expected and investors bought stocks in celebration. We finally got our Green light in the Price column of the Color Guard on Monday and follow-through on Tuesday. I bought a few stocks, did you? </p> <p>If you've been reading these Essays, you know that my favorite way to start the trading day is to open the Stock Viewer (click on Viewers tab, then Stock Viewer) and take a look at the VectorVest Simple graphs of the top 20 VST stocks. I've been doing this for as long as I can remember, and I do it whether the market is going up or down. If the market is trending higher, this technique helps me build a WatchList of stocks that I might buy if the market timing guidance suggests it's a good time to buy, ie. the market is rising. If the market is trending lower, this technique helps me build a WatchList of stocks that I might consider buying WHEN the market starts moving higher. </p> <p>The highest VST stocks are those companies that have the best combination of Relative Value, RV, Relative Safety, RS, and Relative Timing, RT. RV is an indicator of long-term price appreciation potential. RS is an indicator of risk and RT analyzes a stock's price trend. Values above 1.00 are favorable and below 1.00 are unfavorable. The higher above 1.00, the better. So, the top VST Stocks are considered the "best" stocks to buy on any given day. Top VST stocks are a good place to start looking for buy candidates. </p> <p>In my Essay of October 27, 2023, I talked about the VectorVest Secret Weapon, the Comfort Index, CI. As a reminder, CI is an indicator which reflects a stock's ability to resist severe and/or lengthy price declines. CI is also measured on a scale of 0.00 - 2.00 with values above 1.00 being favorable and values below 1.00 being unfavorable. High CI stocks are another good place to look for buy candidates. </p> <p>In any case, as mentioned above, I look at the graphs because graphs tell a story and don't lie. Looking at the VectorVest Simple graphs as a means to cherry-pick high VST stocks was first introduced on December 3, 2004, with Dr. DiLiddo's Essay entitled, "VectorVest Simple." If you haven't read it, it's worth the read, but here's an excerpt: "Simply look at the graphs of the top 20 stocks ranked by VST. Favor those with distinctly rising Price and EPS patterns. Avoid those with excessive volatility and violent drawdowns. It doesn't take long to look at 20 graphs and it's really easy to do. That's why I call it VectorVest Simple."</p> <p>This is a technique you can use with any stock that you're interested in buying, high VST, high CI, etc. For example, last week, the "Magnificent 7" stocks were discussed in the "Special Presentation." Take a look at the VectorVest Simple Graphs of those 7 stocks. Six of the Magnificent 7 stocks have the distinctly rising Price and EPS patterns that Dr. DiLiddo describes in the above mentioned Essay. Tesla is the outlier. Its EPS pattern over the last year has been in a downtrend and it has been the most volatile. That is not a coincidence. </p> <p>If you're not already doing it, use the VectorVest Simple method to help you be A Successful Investor. </p> <p>PS. For more on successful investing, make sure you watch this week's "Special Presentation."<br> <br> <strong>EARNINGS UPDATE</strong><br> According to FactSet, 94% of S&amp;P500 companies have reported their Q3 2023 results with 82% beating their earnings estimates and 62% reporting revenues above estimates. As of tonight, our Market Climate Graph shows that the 50-Day MA of the VV S&amp;P500 WatchList Average EPS, rose $0.02 to $9.74 per share, while forecasted average earnings growth remained unchanged at 7%/yr. The Market Climate Graph shows that the Earnings Trend Indicator, ETI, also remained unchanged at a level of 1.06. Since it remains above 1.00, the market is in a Bull Market Scenario. Stay tuned for our next Earnings Update.</p> <p align="center"><a href="https://trial.vectorvest.com/NTc4LUlYTy02MjIAAAGPf1hEuHqLY2QdeLfglvwNTyOSMm2Ecs6gQazMWWCEnoVfqXdtyfxvPCwlZx1dP_cSvS8330g="><img width="580" alt="Black Friday Sale"></a></p></td>
