<div style="width: 550px; font-size: 18px; font-family: cambria; text-align: left"><i>“Take a sleeping pill.”</i><br>
<br>
That advice PISSES ME OFF, because…<br>
<br>
Ambien or other prescription sleeping pills might help you fall asleep...<br>
<br>
But studies show they actually mess with your brain waves and absolutely destroy the quality of your sleep. That’s why you can sleep 8 hours and still feel exhausted.<br>
<br>
<b>Not to mention, they’re HIGHLY addictive.</b><br>
<br>
Luckily, there’s good news:<br>
<br>
<b>There’s a <a href="http://vivaslimx.us/ap0FaSxChXk8xoYHW_mL7ddBz-5-jsASxkIqzL6vvZlwWFfXXw" rel="sponsored">NEW sleeping </a>pill taking the medical community by storm, because… </b><br>

<br>
&gt; <b>It doesn’t destroy REM Sleep</b><br>
&gt; It’s<b> NATURAL </b><br>
&gt; It’s <b>3,000 years old,</b><br>
&gt; It’s made with 15 rare ingredients scientifically <b>proven to support a deeper sleep</b><br>
&gt; And it <b>reduces chronic pain by 45% </b><br>
&gt; In fact studies show it’s <b>just as good as 400mg of Ibuprofen!</b><br>
<br>
And don’t worry…<br>
<br>
This isn’t some sort of melatonin.<br>
<br>
This rare formula used to only be known to medicine men in India.<br>

During the 1950s, only one Disney short, the stylized Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom, won the Best Short Subject (Cartoons) Oscar. The Mickey Mouse, Pluto and Goofy shorts had all ceased regular production by 1953, with Donald Duck and Humphrey continuing and converting to widescreen CinemaScope before the shorts division was shut down in 1956. After that, all future shorts were produced by the feature films division until 1969. The last Disney short of the golden age of animation was It's Tough to Be a Bird. Disney shorts would only be produced on a sporadic basis from this point on, with notable later shorts including Runaway Brain (1995, starring Mickey Mouse) and Paperman (2012). Despite the 1959 layoffs and competition for Walt Disney's attention from the company's expanded live-action film, TV and theme park departments, production continued on feature animation productions at a reduced level. In 1961, the studio released One Hundred and One Dalmatians, an animated feature that popularized the use of xerography during the process of inking and painting traditional animation cels.
