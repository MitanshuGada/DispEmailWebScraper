<div id="mailctn"><div id="mail"><pre>Hello. I've encountered some information that may surprise you.

 - On this day, I must disclose to you that your device's security measures have been nullified by my efforts, and full access to your account is now in my possession. Your online presence has been under my dedicated scrutiny for a long stretch.
I've introduced a virus into your system, which has provided me with direct control over your device controllers, including the display and camera. Your personal and browsing data is now under my oversight.
I thought what can I do with this data...I recently came up with an interesting idea: to create a video clip in which you masturbate in one part of the screen and watch a porn site in the other, such videos are now at the peak of popularity!
I mean, what we ended up with, it's just... wow.
With just one keystroke, this video could be in the inboxes and feeds of your contacts through email and social platforms. Plus, the private emails and chat apps you use could be compromised.

If you don't want me to do it, send me 800 $ (US dollar) to my Bitcoin wallet.
BTC wallet address-

If you’re at a loss on how to fund a Bitcoin wallet, Google search can lead you to simple instructions.
As soon as the funds are received, I’ll notice it immediately and remove all the unwanted material. After that, we’ll part ways. I also commit to deactivating and removing all malware from your devices. You can trust me, I stand by my word. It’s a fair deal, especially considering the time I’ve invested in tracking your profile and traffic
Please be advised that you have 48 hours from the time of opening this letter to make the payment.

After this period, if I do not receive the specified amount from you, I will send everyone access to your accounts and visited sites, personal data, and edited videos without warning.
Remember this: I do not make mistakes, and I strongly discourage any attempts at humor with me. My resources are ample. Complaining about me is fruitless because they won't be able to trace me. Formatting the drive or destroying the device will be ineffective because I already possess your data.

There's no need to reply to me because I don't send messages from personal email, and I won't be reading any responses
Wishing you the best of luck and hoping you won't get upset! Remember, each of us has our own set of responsibilities, and today it seems you've encountered a tough situation.
Going forward, I'd advise you to observe online safety measures and avoid sketchy websites.
You can enhance your security with Trend Micro or a similar antivirus.
