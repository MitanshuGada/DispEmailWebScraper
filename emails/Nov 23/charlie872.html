It taught me some life-changing lessons about not giving up, trusting your gut and going all-in when it seems worth it.</span></p><p style="line-height: 1.5"><span style="font-size: 16px; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Maybe it’ll do the same for you.</span></p><p style="line-height: 1.5"><span style="font-size: 16px; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">So here we go…</span></p><p style="line-height: 1.5"><span style="font-size: 16px; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Just 3 and half years ago, I had never even touched the stock market.</span></p><p style="line-height: 1.5"><span style="font-size: 16px; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Actually, back then I had no job, little money and about 100,000 dollars in debt.</span></p><p style="line-height: 1.5"><span style="font-size: 16px; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I had worked at a non-profit for over 20 years, where I met my wife, and we lived in a cramped room, barely making enough money for even that.</span></p><p style="line-height: 1.5"><span style="font-size: 16px; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">But as I approached the age of 42, it hit me like a ton of bricks: “I want to start a family and have kids!”</span></p><p style="line-height: 1.5"><span style="font-size: 16px; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The problem was that there was simply no way we could afford to raise a child on top of what we were already struggling to pay for.</span></p><p style="line-height: 1.5"><span style="font-size: 16px; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The even bigger problem was that time was running out. I was 42, and my wife was 34. If we wanted a family, we had to make a change REALLY fast.</span></p><p style="line-height: 1.5"><span style="font-size: 16px; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I had a random range of skills up my sleeve, such as woodworking and carpentry, but nothing that would make a change fast enough for us to have a baby before we got too old. To be honest, it felt hopeless.</span></p><p style="line-height: 1.5"><span style="font-size: 16px; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">But then something happened.</span></p><p style="line-height: 1.5"><span style="font-size: 16px; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I crashed at my brother's place while my wife wrapped things up in another city. Coincidentally, during that time, my brother was trading stocks and options (something I had no interest in), but because we were hanging out, I decided to pay attention.</span></p><p style="line-height: 1.5"><span style="font-size: 16px; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">One morning, he bought a Tesla option for about $300. The next thing blew my mind.</span></p><p style="line-height: 1.5"><span style="font-size: 16px; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">By the end of the day, the value of this option had gone up to a point where he had made an extra $300. 100% profit!!! WHAT?</span></p><p style="line-height: 1.5"><span style="font-size: 16px; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“How is that possible? I don’t understand.” But I was hooked.</span></p><p style="line-height: 1.5"><span style="font-size: 16px; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">So, over the next few weeks, I ended up spending a lot of time watching charts just for fun, wondering if I could learn and also make some profit.</span></p><p style="line-height: 1.5"><span style="font-size: 16px; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">That’s when I noticed something really strange… that I didn’t know was going to end up changing my life.</span></p><p style="line-height: 1.5"><span style="font-size: 16px; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Everyday, around 9:34 am Eastern time, a particular stock would perform a small jump. Every single day. Like clockwork.</span></p><p style="line-height: 1.5"><span style="font-size: 16px; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I shared my discovery with an experienced stock trader, asking him if some stocks indeed had predictable patterns.</span></p><p style="line-height: 1.5"><span style="font-size: 16px; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">He laughed at me and said “Not possible. If anyone could predict the market even a little, they would be incredibly successful.”</span></p><p style="line-height: 1.5"><span style="font-size: 16px; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">…I should have given up right then and there but I couldn’t help myself: I could SEE this pattern!</span></p><p style="line-height: 1.5"><span style="font-size: 16px; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">What if he was wrong… and I was right?</span></p><p style="line-height: 1.5"><span style="font-size: 16px; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">So, I began closely analyzing this daily jump, searching for any potential signals or indicators that might precede it.</span></p><p style="line-height: 1.5"><span style="font-size: 16px; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">After a few more weeks, I finally cracked the code!<br>Here’s the secret, the missing piece of the puzzle…</span></p><p style="line-height: 1.5"><span style="font-size: 16px; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Another big index would always move up right before that predictable jump. That was it!</span></p><p style="line-height: 1.5"><span style="font-size: 16px; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">So, I thought to myself, "Why not give it a shot? All I have to do is buy the stock right before the jump and sell it right after.”</span></p><p style="line-height: 1.5"><span style="font-size: 16px; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">But there was another problem… By this point, I had almost completely run out of money.</span></p><p style="line-height: 1.5"><span style="font-size: 16px; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I had a card with about $1,900 of credit left on it.</span></p><p style="line-height: 1.5"><span style="font-size: 16px; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">So, I made a bold choice. I took a $1,200 cash advance with a 27.9% interest rate attached to it and deposited the money directly into a trading account.</span></p><p style="line-height: 1.5"><span style="font-size: 16px; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">My aim was to make around $60 each day, just enough to cover essential expenses like food and gas.</span></p><p style="line-height: 1.5"><span style="font-size: 16px; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I was either digging my own grave or finally getting out of it.</span></p><p style="line-height: 1.5"><span style="font-size: 16px; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">My first trade was on February 18th, 2020.</span></p><p style="line-height: 1.5"><span style="font-size: 16px; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I waited for the pattern to present itself and I nervously bought a call option for 1,080 dollars just beforehand.</span></p><p style="line-height: 1.5"><span style="font-size: 16px; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The following minutes felt like a lifetime…but the jump happened exactly as I predicted and…I sold for exactly 1,130 dollars.</span></p><p style="line-height: 1.5"><span style="font-size: 16px; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I made my first $50 using the predictable pattern!</span></p><p style="line-height: 1.5"><span style="font-size: 16px; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I was beyond happy and to this day, that first trade on this pattern was the best I have ever felt trading!</span></p><p style="line-height: 1.5"><span style="font-size: 16px; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">So, the next day, I did the same thing. And I made $199!</span></p><p style="line-height: 1.5"><span style="font-size: 16px; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Then on my next trade I made 300 bucks!</span></p><p style="line-height: 1.5"><span style="font-size: 16px; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The next day, I made $185.</span></p><p style="line-height: 1.5"><span style="font-size: 16px; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Over the next few months, I continued trading the same predictable pattern (plus, I discovered a few other similar ones!), and was withdrawing money to cover expenses.</span></p><p style="line-height: 1.5"><span style="font-size: 16px; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Fast forward to today, I’m trading with over hundreds of thousands in my account and making as much as $3000 in around 20 minutes!</span></p><p style="line-height: 1.5"><span style="font-size: 16px; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I cleared my debts, we bought our own house in LA and…</span></p><p style="line-height: 1.5"><span style="font-size: 16px; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The best day of my life happened. I don’t cry often but…I did on this day. We had our son, Owen!</span></p><p style="line-height: 1.5"><span style="font-size: 16px; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">All of this because of that one “secret pattern”!</span></p><p style="line-height: 1.5"><span style="font-size: 16px; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Okay. What does this have to do with you?</span></p><p style="line-height: 1.5"><span style="font-size: 16px; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">So, if you are in a somewhat similar situation and want to follow the same journey, I’ve got a way for you to start on it…</span></p><p style="line-height: 1.5"><span style="font-size: 16px; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I obviously don't publicly reveal my super secret pattern because too many people knowing about it would ruin it for everybody.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="line-height: 1.5"><span style="font-size: 16px; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Long story short: I managed to keep it contained.</span></p><p style="line-height: 1.5"><span style="font-size: 16px; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">In fact, the only time I revealed it in person was at a private 3-day masterclass in Los Angeles.
