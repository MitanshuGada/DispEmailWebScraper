			<p style="padding: 0; color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1); font-size: 11px; line-height: -1px">A major development in this period was the appearance of theatrical representations of Karbala narratives, known as ta'ziya or shabih-khwani. Such theatrical reenactments were likely a natural outgrowth of the verbal reenactments in rawza-khwani, and were rooted in pre-Islamic Iranian heritage, such as the epic poem Ayadgar-i Zariran and the legend of Siyavash, or perhaps the dramatic reenactments of Karbala were inspired by the Christian Corpus Christi processions. At any rate, these performances were popular, often sponsored by the Safavid royals and other elites, and even attended by the Safavid monarchs. The new ritual was also approved by some Safavid scholars, such as the prominent Twelver jurist Majlisi (d. 1699), while independent Shia clerics were initially critical of the performances, partly for their personification of a Shia imam. From Iran, ta'ziya later reached Iraq and then Lebanon, but had limited success in the former. Modern times Takia Dawlat in a painting by Kamal-ol-molk, dated 1892</p>

			<p style="padding: 0; color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1); font-size: 11px; line-height: -1px">In Iran, the ritual condemnation of the first three caliphs was discontinued after the Safavids. As early as the Qajar period (r. 1789–1925), Iranian rituals also extended to the month of Safar, due to the commemoration of Arbai'n, which marks forty days after the death of Husayn. Also in the Qajar era, the theatrical reenactment of Karbala (ta'ziya) reached its peak. In the Qajar capital Tehran, the most elaborate shows took place in Takia Dawlat, built by the Qajar monarch Naser al-Din Shah (r. 1848–1896).</p>

			<p style="padding: 0; color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1); font-size: 11px; line-height: -1px">Ta'ziya fell into a slow decline in Iran afterward, to the point that it became a rarity in large cities by the 1940s under the Pahlavis (r. 1925–1979). Besides the emergence of new art mediums, the decline in ta'ziya can be partly explained by Pahlavi bans and restrictions, as part of their program to modernize Iran. The modernization was likely a guise, however, for the Pahlavis probably saw Muharram rituals as a political threat. Indeed, as early as the 1909 constitutional revolution in Iran, mourning gatherings had assumed a political dimension as preachers compared Iranian oppressors to the enemies of Husayn in Karbala. Eventually, the Pahlavis were toppled in the</p>

Favoring the Sunni community, the Iraqi president Saddam Hussein (d. 2006) also banned Muharram rituals, but they resumed shortly after he was deposed in 2003. In Saudi Arabia, such rituals have been banned since Ibn Saud reimposed Wahhabi rule over the country, although the ban has been defied at times by the discontented Shia minority, protesting what they perceive as Saudi discrimination. In Lebanon, Muharram rituals show Iranian roots and were restrained until about the mid nineteenth century. Later, Karbala symbolism was used there effectively against the Israeli occupation (1985–2000). Extreme forms of self-flagellation have also been banned in Iran and the Hezbollah party of Lebanon since the mid-90s. South Asia</p>

			<p style="padding: 0; color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1); font-size: 11px; line-height: -1px">In the Safavid era, annual mourning gatherings (majalis) were held on the first ten days of Muharram in Husainiyyas, a term coined in this period for buildings dedicated to ritual mourning. In such gatherings, narratives of Karbala were emotionally recounted in the ritual of rawza-khwani, which owes its name to the 1502–1503 book Rawzat al-shuhada, perhaps the most famous collection of Karbala narratives to date. The recitation of the book was later abandoned as trained story-tellers relied on their creative skills to conjure up the narratives. Other notable Safavid rituals were Muharram processions and self-flagellation, such as sina-zani (striking the chest), zanjir-zani (striking the back with chains), and tiq-zani or qama-zani (mortifying oneself with swords or knives). The extreme acts of self-flagellation were new practices, as there is no evidence of self-inflicted bloodshed in early historical sources. Such rituals likely originated in Turkish-speaking regions of Caucasus and Azerbayjan in Northern Iran, introduced into Shi'ism by the Qizilbash, who formed the backbone of the Safavid military and were regarded as Ghulat because of their exaggerated veneration for the Shia imams. In turn, extreme self-flagellation had perhaps reached these regions from Europe, where it was practiced by some Christians as a form of atonement.</p>
