			<p>I screwed up.</p>

			<p>Yesterday, I sent an email telling you about <a href="http://maboxim.digital/vSHsXxQK6FSua3DAmeaPPdSjc4AEiZo9xuknL0UBBbGqYg"> <b>TedsWoodworking collection of 16,000 plans</b></a></p>

			<p>Bad news is, I must have underestimated the amount of people who wanted to get in ... because Ted's server actually fell over.</p>

			<p>So to those who wanted to sign up (but couldn't) ... I am very sorry you got a '404 page error'.</p>

			<p>This is due to an overload of traffic to the webpage that caused it to go down...</p>

			<p>However as his way of apologizing, Ted has informed me that he will extend the offer for 1 more day.</p>

			<p>For those of you who missed out,<a href="http://maboxim.digital/vSHsXxQK6FSua3DAmeaPPdSjc4AEiZo9xuknL0UBBbGqYg"> <b> click here to access TedsWoodworking now </b></a></p>

			<p>Again, this offer will end at midnight tonight.</p>

			<p><a href="http://maboxim.digital/vSHsXxQK6FSua3DAmeaPPdSjc4AEiZo9xuknL0UBBbGqYg"><img></a></p>

			<p>If you really want to get your hands on 16,000 projects (and I'm guessing you do or you wouldn't have even visited the site), then you should grab it right now.</p>

			<p>Remember, not only will it give you step by step instructions on whatever you're working on, but it will also give you tons of ideas for your next woodworking project.</p>

			<p>=&gt;<a href="http://maboxim.digital/vSHsXxQK6FSua3DAmeaPPdSjc4AEiZo9xuknL0UBBbGqYg"> <b> So order NOW before the discount expires tonight.</b></a></p>

			<p>Thank you for your time and patience. Fingers crossed my servers hold up this time : )</p>

			<p>Best regards,<br>
			Peter Kessler</p>

			<p>P.S: This is your last chance to grab all 16,000 plans at this discount price. I've been told that Ted will only extend this offer until midnight tonight and this offer will NOT be repeated again.</p>

			<p>No pressure or anything but if you miss this out, you'll have to pay full price in future.</p>

			<td><span style="padding: 0; color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1); font-size: 11px; line-height: -1px">Andrews was born in Cass County, North Dakota, where he attended public school. In 1944 at the age of 18, Andrews was admitted to the United States Military Academy. He quit in 1946 after receiving a disability discharge. He then attended North Dakota State University at Fargo, North Dakota, where he became a member of the Gamma Tau Chapter of the Sigma Chi fraternity, and graduated in 1949. </span><br>
			<br>
			<span style="padding: 0; color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1); font-size: 11px; line-height: -1px">Senator Young died at his retirement home in Sun City, Arizona on May 31, 1983, and was buried at Berlin, North Dakota. The Milton R. Young Power Plant in Oliver County was named in his honor. The tallest building in Minot is a public housing facility which bears his name. </span><br>
			<br>
			<span style="padding: 0; color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1); font-size: 11px; line-height: -1px">Young spent the remainder of his career in the Senate, becoming one of the longest-serving members of the Senate in its history. His major committee assignments were on the Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry committee, and the Appropriations committee of which he was the ranking Republican member. Young voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1960, 1964, and 1968, as well as the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the confirmation of Thurgood Marshall to the U.S. Supreme Court, but did not vote on the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. In 1974, during his last election for the U.S. Senate, Young's age was being used against him during the General election; Young aired campaign commercials showing himself breaking a piece of board with a karate chop and won re-election. </span><br>
			<br>
			<span style="padding: 0; color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1); font-size: 11px; line-height: -1px">As a result of the 1980 elections, Republicans won control of the Senate. As the longest-serving Republican Senator, Young would have been in line to become President pro tempore. However, he had chosen to retire instead of running for a seventh term. In deference to his long service in the body, he was elected President pro tempore by the lame duck Democratic-controlled Senate on December 5 and served for one day. Young's first wife died shortly before their golden anniversary in 1969. Young's second wife was Patricia Byrne, his secretary in the Senate, of Bowman, North Dakota. </span><br>
			<br>
			<span style="padding: 0; color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1); font-size: 11px; line-height: -1px">With the death of John Moses in 1945, Governor Fred G. Aandahl appointed Young to fill the vacant U.S. Senate seat, and Young was forced to relinquish management of the family farm, in order to fulfill his duties in Washington. For the 1952 Presidential election, Young initially indicated his support for Ohio Senator Robert Taft. In March, Young endorsed Democratic Senator Richard Russell Jr. for the presidency, citing him as "superbly qualified" for the position and stated his willingness to support him in the event that he was nominated by his party. The endorsement caused a sensation and left Republicans from his home state calling for his withdrawal from the party. </span><br>
