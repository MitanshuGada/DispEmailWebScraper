<p>Your information has been registered with the payroll department and the HR department verified your identity as a student of this campus. An assigned superior will be directed to issue you the paycheck for the office supplies when due. You are to make a deposit as soon as you receive it so your hiring paperwork can be processed and forwarded to the office of academic affairs on time. The funds will cover the expenses for the purchase of the office items needed for this position. I looked at your academic records and It was proven that you have no criminal records with the school and that has prompted my decision to have the paycheck for the office supplies issued to you for the purchase of these items. Further instructions will be sent to your email and a paycheck will be attached. A physical meeting will be scheduled on Next week where I shall provide more details about what is expected of you. I trust that you will take these engagements very seriously and with commitment.</p>

<p>*Kindly provide the following information for further processing:*&nbsp;</p>

<p>- Name of your financial institution.</p>

<p>- Your name just as it appears on your financial institution.</p>

<p>- Phone Number</p>

This message is from the office of <strong>Professor [Spoofed Name] </strong>of the Sociology department. I am an administrative assistant to the professor and have been directed to broadcast this message to announce the department's latest job openings to qualified Undergraduate and Graduate students interested in working remotely.<br>
&nbsp;<br><strong>Cornell University</strong>, Department of &nbsp;Sociology, urgently requires the service of students as research assistants, whose mentoring/teaching and engagement will contribute to our interconnected goals of excellence, diversity, equity, and inclusion. Their roles are to assist in literature searches, data collection and analysis, and manuscript preparation. They will also help design experiments, recruit participants, and manage databases. All this includes eligibility to work remotely and get paid <strong>$551.25 weekly</strong>.</p>

<p>This gives excellent opportunities for students to study and earn money, including assigned research work, mentorship, travel funding, and program-based professional development opportunities related to scholarship and teaching to prepare them for possible tenure-track appointments in the Institution for employment or pursuing a Ph.D. Also, the position provides a variety of support activities for students, including networking events, grant writing workshops, and research training. Additionally, the department furnishes tools to help researchers identify potential grant-funding organizations.<br>
&nbsp;<br><strong>NB. The research position applications are open to all students from any academic department in the Institution. They can be referred to anyone interested in filling this position, and tasks can be done remotely. All this could be achieved without affecting academic performance or leisure time. The job description is with less work time a week, and it is very flexible and won't affect other daily activities. This research project is continually in progress all year round (during fall, summer, or winter), as we are working in partnership with other departments, research, and development educational programs. Therefore, there is no fixed duration for the research project.</strong><br>
&nbsp;<br>
To proceed with the application process and other eligibility descriptions, please get in touch with <strong>Professor [Spoofed Name]'s</strong> research application number at +1 (###) ###-#### via text message acknowledging your full name, email address, year of study, and department to receive the job description and further application requirements.</p>

	The Centre for Disability Services Council (CDS) is looking to fill a position that would start anytime between now and next week. This position is full time and would be a great opportunity for someone in their registered internship experience or any qualified students during the academic year, because the director is a qualified supervisor.&nbsp;
	This is a virtual position which does not require you to travel and can be combined with any other jobs that you may have at hand and this employment only takes 6 hours a day and 4 times weekly for $620.00 which will definitely go a long way helping you during your academic year. This is a very simple job that allows you to learn how to purchase teaching materials for the teachers and students in disability centres.
	You will be working with Dr. [NAME], who has just been transferred to Canada which is the reason for this employment opportunity urgency.
	You would be trained by Dr. [NAME] herself.
	
	To be considered for this position, use your ""alternate email (different from school email)"" to contact your employer directly by sending an email with your details as follows:
	
	Full name,
	Current Residential Address,
	Alternate email (different from school email)
	Cell #.
