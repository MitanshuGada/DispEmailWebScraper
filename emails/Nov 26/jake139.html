<div id="mailctn"><div id="mail"><pre>Attention,

I know it will be a great surprise reading from me today but consider
this a divine intervention. My name is Mrs. Mary Johnson, a widow from
Milwaukee, WI 53204. I am presently writing you from my sickbed
because I have been fighting cancer and the doctor says I have a few
weeks left.

I want to entrust my money $8.5 million dollars to your care for
charity purposes and crave your indulgence as a concerned individual
to help use my money for charity and also assist the poor with less
privileged in the society so reply to my private email (marjohnson613@gmail.com)
for more information as I'm not always
online due to my health and my late husband's brother wants me dead so
that he will claim all my late husband and I worked for.

I will tell you more about myself and what you need to do with the
money once you receive it. Give me your word that you will not betray
my trust so that i furnish you with more details about the Charity
Funds. Please reply now as my health is pretty bad, Itâ€™s urgent and
It is very important that you keep this email confidential.

Have a blessed day and do not forget to pray for me.

Bless you.
Mrs. Mary Johnson</pre></div></div>
