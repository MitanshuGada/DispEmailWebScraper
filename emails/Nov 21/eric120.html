<span style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)">On March 5, 2014, Julie Beck writing The Atlantic magazine in an article titled "Doctors' Source Healthcare Inmation: Wikipedia", stated that "Fifty percent of physicians look up conditions on the (Wikipedia) site, and some are editing articles themselves to improve the quality of available inmation." Beck continued to detail in this article new programs of Amin Azzam at the University of San Francisco to medical school courses to medical students ling to edit and improve Wikipedia articles on health-related issues, as well as internal quality control programs within Wikipedia organized by James Heilman to improve a group of 200 health-related articles of central medical importance up to Wikipedia's highest standard of articles using its Featured Article and Good Article peer-review evaluation process. In a May 7, 2014 follow-up article in The Atlantic titled "Can Wikipedia Ever Be a Definitive Medical Text?", Julie Beck s WikiProject 's James Heilman as stating: "Just because a reference is peer-reviewed doesn't mean it's a high-quality reference." Beck ded that: "Wikipedia has its own peer review process bee articles can be classified as 'good' or 'featured'. Heilman, who has participated in that process bee, says 'less than percent' of Wikipedia's medical articles have passed." Coverage of topics and systemic bias See also: Notability in the English Wikipedia and Criticism of Wikipedia § Systemic bias in coverage Wikipedia seeks to create a summary of all human kledge in the m of an online encyclopedia, with each topic covered encyclopediy in article. Since it has terabytes of disk space, it can have far more topics than can be covered by any printed encyclopedia. The exact degree and manner of coverage on Wikipedia is under constant review by its editors, and disagreements are not uncommon (see deletionism and inclusionism). Wikipedia contains materials that some people may find objectionable, offensive, or pornographic. The "Wikipedia is not censored" policy has somes proved controversial: in 2008, Wikipedia rejected an online petition against the inclusion of images of Muhamm in the English edition of its Muhamm article, citing this policy. The presence of politiy, religiously, and pornographiy sensitive materials in Wikipedia has led to the censorship of Wikipedia by national authorities in China and Pakistan, amongst other countries. Pie chart of Wikipedia content by subject as of January 2008 A 2008 study conducted by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University and Palo Alto Research Center gave a distribution of topics as well as growth (from July 2006 to January 2008) in each field: Culture and Arts: 30% (210%) Biographies and persons: 15% (97%) Geography and places: 14% (52%) Society and social sciences: 12% (83%) History and events: 11% (143%) Natural and Physical Sciences: 9% (213%) Technology and Applied Science: 4% (−6%) Religions and belief systems: 2% (38%) Health: 2% (42%) Mathematics and logic: 1% (146%) Thought and Philosophy: 1% (160%) </span><br>
