Helpfully, the folks over at Fidelity have put together a report that examines the criticisms people have of Bitcoin. They’ve got to do something to while away the time as they wait for the SEC to approve their spot Bitcoin ETF application, after all.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin: 0">The report looks at the nine pain points that Fidelity’s investors have consistently complained of in relation to Bitcoin over the last few years. It also divides them into two categories: misconceptions and potentially valid criticisms. It’s a fascinating and well-timed deep dive into the way Bitcoin is perceived by those outside of crypto.<br>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin: 0">In today’s video, we go through this report and dissect its findings.

Lock and load.<br>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin: 0">📈<strong> Crypto Market Forecast 📈</strong></p><p style="margin: 0">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin: 0">This week will be an interesting blend of crypto and macro. For starters, by tomorrow the judge in the Binance case <a href="https://4sou9.r.a.d.sendibm1.com/mk/cl/f/sh/7nVU1aA2nfuMSVm4dqB3aeFH33KSUQk/QT65fLlG_xD0" style="color: rgba(0, 146, 255, 1); text-decoration: underline"><u>will decide</u></a> whether or not CZ is allowed to leave the US between now and his trial date in February.&nbsp;</p><p style="margin: 0">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin: 0">On the flipside, it’s likely that we will get some bullish crypto news out of Argentina. That’s because the new president, Javier Milei, is believed to be pro-crypto. He also wants to dollarize the country’s economy. As reported by <a href="https://4sou9.r.a.d.sendibm1.com/mk/cl/f/sh/7nVU1aA2nfwFS2HNcPPVd0Z5DPpFENG/IQ0vS8KwthuU" style="color: rgba(0, 146, 255, 1); text-decoration: underline"><u>CoinTelegraph</u></a>, it's possible that stablecoins could play a role in this dollarization.&nbsp;</p><p style="margin: 0">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin: 0">This relates to a peculiar Ethereum project that’s been raising a few eyebrows. A layer 2 called <a href="https://4sou9.r.a.d.sendibm1.com/mk/cl/f/sh/7nVU1aA2nfy8RYmgaydxfMstNmK1yJm/wZf6xxcYLW5P" style="color: rgba(0, 146, 255, 1); text-decoration: underline"><u>‘Blast’</u></a> was announced last week, and has since accumulated around 300 million dollars of crypto, mostly ETH staked through Lido Finance (stETH). This has caused some concerns given that it’s only possible to deposit, not withdraw (more about that below).&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin: 0">This could present a tail risk for Ethereum, which is otherwise looking pretty strong. As you’ve probably heard by now, <a href="https://4sou9.r.a.d.sendibm1.com/mk/cl/f/sh/7nVU1aA2ng01R5HzZXsPhjChY8ooiGI/vkPb-tzyvLAv" style="color: rgba(0, 146, 255, 1); text-decoration: underline"><u>multiple asset managers</u></a> have filed applications for spot Ethereum ETFs. Chances are that we will see some more meaningful announcements about these applications in the coming weeks, and they’re likely to be bullish for ETH.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin: 0">At the macro level meanwhile, the <a href="https://4sou9.r.a.d.sendibm1.com/mk/cl/f/sh/7nVU1aA2ng1uQbnIY76rk5WViVJbSCo/z-YRTAfYxyRg" style="color: rgba(0, 146, 255, 1); text-decoration: underline"><u>ceasefire in Gaza</u></a> (which began on Friday) is expected to continue until tomorrow. After that, we could see some more turbulence in the broader markets if the fighting returns with a vengeance. We could also see more FUD about crypto being used for terrorist financing if this is the case.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin: 0">This ties into the OPEC meeting, which is expected to take place this Thursday. Interestingly enough, the meeting was supposed to happen on Sunday, but was apparently pushed back due to disagreements about product cuts (or the lack thereof). <a href="https://4sou9.r.a.d.sendibm1.com/mk/cl/f/sh/7nVU1aA2ng3nQ8IbWgLJmRqJsroOC9K/JxeUg7w-ur_5" style="color: rgba(0, 146, 255, 1); text-decoration: underline"><u>Some analysts warn</u></a> that another production cut could boost oil prices.&nbsp;</p><p style="margin: 0">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin: 0">An increase in oil prices could result in inflation, which has been declining according to the CPI. The other inflation statistic the markets are watching closely is the PCE, the Fed’s favourite. The October PCE will also be <a href="https://4sou9.r.a.d.sendibm1.com/mk/cl/f/sh/7nVU1aA2ng5gPenuVFZlooA83EJAw5q/FLuicIkG300s" style="color: rgba(0, 146, 255, 1); text-decoration: underline"><u>released this Thursday</u></a>. It will be an important print given that the PCE appears to have flattened. Any move could mark the start of a new trend.&nbsp;</p><p style="margin: 0">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin: 0">At the same time, it appears that long-term interest rates in the US are <a href="https://4sou9.r.a.d.sendibm1.com/mk/cl/f/sh/7nVU1aA2ng7ZPBJDTooDrATwDanxg2M/NqGAa4naEUag" style="color: rgba(0, 146, 255, 1); text-decoration: underline"><u>starting to rise</u></a> again. For reference, the interest rate on the 10-year treasury recently hit 5 percent, but pulled back sharply. Now it’s rising again. If this turns out to be a new uptrend, it could put pressure on the markets, particularly risk assets.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin: 0">Thankfully, Bitcoin’s correlation to the stock market is <a href="https://4sou9.r.a.d.sendibm1.com/mk/cl/f/sh/7nVU1aA2ng9SOhoWSO2ftWnkNxIkPys/Fv6I7wddXyv4" style="color: rgba(0, 146, 255, 1); text-decoration: underline"><u>at multi-year lows</u></a>.

Especially since Blast assures users that all ETH and stablecoins bridged to the chain automatically earn a fixed yield of 4% and 5% respectively, irrespective of whether that asset is in their wallet or staked on a dapp on-chain.</p><p style="margin: 0 0 8pt">Combine this with other factors, such as the person behind the project being Tieshun Roquerre (aka Pacman), the founder of NFT marketplace Blur, and the project raising over <a href="https://4sou9.r.a.d.sendibm1.com/mk/cl/f/sh/WCPzyXJTZ7Aw4yITtKMzwccistMVpy7u/p8YDKGImJGua" style="color: rgba(0, 146, 255, 1); text-decoration: underline"><u>$20 million</u></a> from VCs such as Paradigm and Standard Crypto, and you’ve successfully created something that figures in every degenerate crypto DeFi farmer’s wildest wet dream.</p><p style="margin: 0 0 8pt">At the time of writing, over <a href="https://4sou9.r.a.d.sendibm1.com/mk/cl/f/sh/WCPzyXJTZ7Ij90VkFPqfiMmW1gFd5fk2/XPgfUV4fK5iz" style="color: rgba(0, 146, 255, 1); text-decoration: underline"><u>$370M</u></a> in assets have already been bridged to Blast in the 72 hours since launch. For <a href="https://4sou9.r.a.d.sendibm1.com/mk/cl/f/sh/WCPzyXJTZ7QWD2j0bVKLU6wJAT8kLNMA/wQfv8L7LF3o1" style="color: rgba(0, 146, 255, 1); text-decoration: underline"><u>context</u></a>, that’s more than half the TVL present in chains like Solana and Avalanche. This is no small feat, especially when you consider that depositors will be unable to withdraw all those bridged funds until February next year.&nbsp;</p><p style="margin: 0 0 8pt">The euphoria surrounding Blast is clearly undeniable.&nbsp;</p><p style="margin: 0 0 8pt">Having said that, there are many who’ve expressed concerns about the project’s marketing approach and security measures. Notably, many have called it a Ponzi scheme, <a href="https://4sou9.r.a.d.sendibm1.com/mk/cl/f/sh/WCPzyXJTZ7YJH4wGxao1Fr66JG1rb4yI/em4KvcDZqxAg" style="color: rgba(0, 146, 255, 1); text-decoration: underline"><u>comparing</u></a> it to the likes of Luna and Bitconnect.</p><p style="margin: 0 0 8pt">The subject of controversy seems to be Blast’s onboarding and marketing strategy. Put simply, Blast is using a tiered referral system similar to those used by multi-level marketing companies to onboard users.</p><p style="margin: 0 0 8pt">Specifically, Blast features an airdrop program for early adopters that rewards users with 16% of the airdrop points farmed by their direct referrals and 8% of the airdrop points farmed by the referrals of their referrals.&nbsp;</p><p style="margin: 0 0 8pt">To be fair, referrals and gamified adoption schemes have been the norm in crypto for the past few months – just take a look at the friend.tech meta.</p><p style="margin: 0 0 8pt">And for reasons we’ll look at shortly, we don’t think this is nearly as bad as the risks presented by the next two factors – security and security.</p><p style="margin: 0 0 8pt">The first security refers to concerns around the safety of funds. As noted by many, including <a href="https://4sou9.r.a.d.sendibm1.com/mk/cl/f/sh/WCPzyXJTZ7g6L79XJgHh1bFtS2uyqmaQ/NPj-1XlRIUDA" style="color: rgba(0, 146, 255, 1); text-decoration: underline"><u>Adam Cochran</u></a> and <a href="https://4sou9.r.a.d.sendibm1.com/mk/cl/f/sh/WCPzyXJTZ7ntP9MnfllMnLPgapo66UCY/t9fa8aQuJQbz" style="color: rgba(0, 146, 255, 1); text-decoration: underline"><u>Sisyphus</u></a>, the Blast L2 ‘bridge’ is currently just an Ethereum mainnet contract owned by a five person multisig, without any L2 capabilities.&nbsp;</p><p style="margin: 0 0 8pt">This means that all funds deposited are currently under the control of these five wallet addresses. As noted by Polygon engineer <a href="https://4sou9.r.a.d.sendibm1.com/mk/cl/f/sh/WCPzyXJTZ7vgTBa41rF2Z5ZTjchDMBog/8p-R2GiT9cj8" style="color: rgba(0, 146, 255, 1); text-decoration: underline"><u>Jarrod Watts</u></a>, the five signer wallets of Blast's multi-signature contract are all new addresses and their identities are unknown. This exposes users to potential rug pull risks, though this scenario is unlikely considering the team and the VCs behind the project have placed their reputations at stake.</p><p style="margin: 0 0 8pt">Additionally, Jarrod <a href="https://4sou9.r.a.d.sendibm1.com/mk/cl/f/sh/WCPzyXJTZ83TXDnKNwiiKpjGsPaKbtQo/sPAj_nomFJT2" style="color: rgba(0, 146, 255, 1); text-decoration: underline"><u>noted</u></a> that the contract was upgradeable and also detailed potential vulnerabilities, specifically the “enableTransition” function and the “mainnetBridge” contract. Theoretically, attackers could exploit these elements to allow unrestricted access to all bridged ETH and DAI, posing a considerable risk to investors’ assets.</p><p style="margin: 0 0 8pt">As for the second ‘security,’ it refers to the favourite word of our beloved Mr. Gensler and the SEC. That’s right, the current setup of Blast carries significant regulatory risk. To refresh your memory, the US Securities and Exchange Commission has been on the warpath over the past few months, cracking down hard even on projects whose models could only be defined as securities under a dystopian legal framework.</p><p style="margin: 0 0 8pt">Having said that, Blast’s system of pooling funds and delegating them for yield rewards presents centralisation and intermediary risks. Combine this with the marketing language of promising ‘risk-free’ returns, you have the perfect candidate for a securities law violation.&nbsp;</p><p style="margin: 0 0 8pt">There’s a higher chance of this risk affecting the project first, especially since Blast does not prevent US residents from interacting with its platform.&nbsp;</p><p style="margin: 0 0 8pt">It hasn’t even been a year since the SEC went after entities like <a href="https://4sou9.r.a.d.sendibm1.com/mk/cl/f/sh/WCPzyXJTZ6vNptOSU7ysrAfSPTwm7IqA/Tini0ZE99jL1" style="color: rgba(0, 146, 255, 1); text-decoration: underline"><u>Kraken</u></a> for similar offerings. Frankly, we’re confused about how none of the VCs or team members behind Blast considered this to be a potential issue.</p><p style="margin: 0 0 8pt">So, with all that in mind, we would be wary of YOLOing into Blast, at least until mainnet launches and the project becomes sufficiently decentralised.</p><p style="margin: 0"><strong>📊 Guy’s Personal Portfolio 📊</strong></p><p style="margin: 0">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin: 0">If you’re subscribed to <a href="https://4sou9.r.a.d.sendibm1.com/mk/cl/f/sh/WCPzyXJTZ73AtvbiqDSYcupFYGptN0SI/2hNa4WNTHH13" style="color: rgba(0, 146, 255, 1); text-decoration: underline"><u>Coin Bureau Club</u></a>, you’ll have seen that Guy felt the FOMO this past week and decided to ape into quite a controversial altcoin.<br>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin: 0">It’s a relatively small allocation and the plan is to sell out of the position if the project sees some healthy gains over the next week or so.
