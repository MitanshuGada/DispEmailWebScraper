<div id="mailctn"><div id="mail"><div><div style="font-family: Roboto, Arial; font-size: 14px"><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was sitting there with my wife, talking about how the kids are going respectively</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Isn’t it crazy how different each of them are, i bet you feel the same with yours</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And we were reflecting and comparing memories of when our eldest was the same age as the younger two</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then it just hit both of us at the same time</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s a weird thing, moving through life</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Little changes stack up with grey hairs and a few more wrinkles</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But man</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The speed of irreversible change is real when we look at our kids</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And of course thats supposed to happen, they’re growing</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But it was almost like a sorrow that we felt</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because what’s happening is exactly that - irreversible</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You can’t even slow down time, let alone stop it</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Have you tried to sit there and watch the clock</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I have lately, it seemed so slow and painful when i was young</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But now, when i watched the seconds hand the other day</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was insane</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Do it, give it a try, it’s pretty scary man</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That seconds hand was moving SO FAST</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And every second i watched, disappeared, gone</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Into the abyss of the eternal “past”</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt an anxiety come over me talking with my wife</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It hit me, and i’m the perspective king</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The fact that every age and stage of our children will come to pass</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And we'll be old&nbsp;</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Things will be remembered</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Things will be forgotten</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We will die</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And the world keeps turning</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’m not here to plead or beg you</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But fuck mate, DO NOT relinquish the opportunity you have</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To go ALL IN on your life and your family</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I know death is coming for me, as it is for you</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But what i also know is that with a heartbeat and head</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can do something about my “now”</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And you can too</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Don’t waste it man</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The greatest and most rewarding thing we can do in this world is grow and develop</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Become better than we were last month, last year</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And channel that into the leadership and experiences we provide for our children&nbsp;</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So that they remain connected to us on a deeper level over the years</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But also so that they want to as well, because you are them and they are you</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Life is precious, it’s strange to think of what happens after</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No name, no identity, no more reality inside your life with you and your kids</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why would any man want to waste it right now then?</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Give your kids a hug, tell them you love them</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Go out and hunt, provide for your family</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But don’t lose yourself and your family in the process</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And the only way that can ever happen is evolution</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To become more than you are so you can have more than you’ve got</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What a crazy game it is</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Til tomorrow</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Claim today</span></p>
