<div id="mailctn"><div id="mail"><pre>Often I identify as a happy half-hermit, often cutting myself off from the rest of the world in the midst of the madness but then I remind myself that building community can be the key to longevity, resilience, sustainability and happiness!  Jules here pondering the different forms of community of which we are sitting in the midst of the largest permaculture community online.  Hoopla!


What about intentional community?  I once lived in a cooperative and there were definite up sides, and some memorable lows. I love hearing about the experiences of others, and think it can offer some valuable insights for all living situations and is often also entertaining and educational!  Take a look at some new publications available that might just hit the spot:

I like the idea of a repair circle within a community to divert items from landfill, learn some valuable skills and strengthening community ties, as well as plenty of other benefits!  Can you share your experience of a similar set up?

And, in case you didn't know, there is a whole community forum on permies, which includes a noticeboard of sorts for posting about opportunities, discussions on decision making, communication and personal challenges, permaculture singles and more besides.

And of course, there is the wonderful permaculture community on the ground, at Wheaton Labs.  If you'd like to treat yourself to an immersive experience, or know someone who could benefit from it, take a look.  You'll learn some practical permaculture skills and be part of a like-minded community.  There are a host of benefits to being a part of the bootcamp, short or long term:

On my planet I'm considered quite beautiful.  Thanks to the poetry in this tiny ad:
