                Your office payroll is set to issue every (WEEK, MONTH, BI-WEEK, BI-MONTH – MOST WILL BE BI-MONTH), and
                your next payroll date is expected to be on (15th, 30th, etc). This report covers data from 10 Th to
                22 th, which will be used for this next payroll period.
                <br> <br>
                Please review the data for accuracy, and report any issues to your MANAGER.
                <br> <br>
                This is also your opportunity to see if you are missing any PHOTO uploads as this may impact the status
                of your project’s COMPLETION which includes JOB, PHOTO SUBMISSIONS, and COLLECTION OF PAYMENT.
                <br> <br>
                Be sure to ensure that your project includes your BEFORE and AFTER images for the project. This data is
                used by the business to promote the business to new clients, and is also used to confirm completion of
                the project. This is also intended to enable you to confirm that all projects you worked on are
                reflected in the report, so any discrepancies can be addressed prior to payroll finalization and
                issuance.
                <br> <br>
                We appreciate your efforts as always.
