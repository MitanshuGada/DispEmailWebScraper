# DispEmailWebScraper
<h3>Technologies Used</h3>
<ul>
<li>Python</li>
<li>Selenium</li>
<li>Chrome</li>
</ul>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>This is a web scraper which scrapes the disposable email service "yopmail.com" and only select usernames.</p>

<p>I am using selenium web driver and python to scrape the website for emails.</p>

<p><strong>Limitation:</strong> yopmail.com detects the use of a robot and will block the script to access the email, for that I manually go to the website and verify the captcha as not a robot and then it starts scraping again.</p>
