The rituals were perhaps introduced there by Timur (d. 1405), the founder of the Timurid Empire (r. 1370–1507), or perhaps through the migration of some Iranian elites to South Asia. Muharram rituals were later suppressed by the Mughals (r. 1526–1857) from the sixteenth century onward, but reemerged when the Mughals weakened in the eighteenth century, for instance, in Awadh under the patronage of its Shia ruler Saadat Ali Khan I (d. 1739). In particular, the Shia rulers of Awadh sponsored Mirza Dabeer (d. 1875) and Mir Anees (d. 1874), two prominent Karbala elegy composers in Urdu literature. Perhaps also influenced by Iraq and Iran, there were dedicated buildings for Muharram rituals in South Asia by the end of the sixteenth century, known variously as imambarah, imambaragh, azakhana, Ashurakhana, and ta'ziyakhana. These rituals even found their way to Trinidad when Indian immigrants settled there in the nineteenth century. Influenced by local carnivals, however, Muharram rituals lost their mourning tone there.
