<div style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1); font-size: 5px">Sarah Horton Cockrell was born in Virginia to Enoch Horton and Martha Horton on January 13, 1819. Her family was among the earliest pioneers to the Dallas County in 1844. Sarah married Alexander Cockrell on September 9, 1847. Their union produced five children. Sarah and her husband lived in a tent on Mountain Creek until they were able to purchase a headright along the Trinity River, the last remaining townsite in Dallas, from John Neely Bryan. Together Sarah and her husband engaged in several ventures including running the Trinity River ferry service, which formed a part of the acquisition from Bryan. They were also involved in brick-making, construction, real estate, and operated a sawmill. Sarah's husband was killed in 1858. She subsequently took over management of the family businesses with assistance from her son and son-in-law. She managed three hotels. A year after her husband's death she opened the St. Nicholas Hotel but it was destroyed in the 1860 Dallas fire. She subsequently opened the Dallas Hotel and later the St. Charles. Sarah Horton Cockrell continued to expand the family business, to establish her family as one of the more eminent in Dallas. Her enterprises spanned various industries.
