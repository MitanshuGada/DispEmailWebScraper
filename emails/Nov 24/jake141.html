Our Ref: FGN /SNT/STB

Compliment of the season, I have to inform you again, that we are not playing over this, I know my reason for the continuous sending of this notification to you, the fact is that you can't seem to trust any one again over this payment for what you have been in cantered in many months ago, but I want you to trust me, I cannot scam you for $59 it is for bank processing of your payment, the fees of $59 is clearly written to you before, I did not invent the bill to defraud you of $59 it is an official bank payment processing fee, and the good part of this, is that you will never, ever be disturbed again over any kind of payment, this is final, and the forms from there becomes effective once we submit your payment application processing fee and pay the form fee of $59 I don't want you to loose this fund this time, because you may never get another such good opportunity, the federal government is keen and very determined to pay your overdue debts, this is not a fluke, I would not ! Want yo
 u to loose this fund out.

The processing charges which was initially on the high price has been cut down by the payout bank considering the poor economic situations that make it difficult for the middle class citizens to meet up with the processing charges of their entitlement. Upon the confirmation of your processing charges you will get your $2.500, 000.00 into your account within 15hrs.

Only what you will do now is to Contact us back if you are interested of receiving you fund and information will be given to you were to send the bank processing charges to avoid wrong transaction, finally my advice to you is not to abandon this transaction because of the requirement of ($59)

As soon as the payment is received, you will receive your $2.5M the same today without any delay.

Best Regards
Mrs. Jenifer Willie</pre></div></div>
