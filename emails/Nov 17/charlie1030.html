Hello charlie@yopmail.com,
 
The Standard Chartered bank gave me a last warning notice to get 
the Next of Kin of Late Edward or the funds US$6.9m shall be 
declared Unclaimed and sent into government treasury. This 
transaction is 100% real and does not have any criminal origin. 
He died intestate (without a next of kin or will).You are 
qualified by your name identity and I believe it's an opportunity 
for us to regain everything we've lost in the past.100% trust 
this email belongs to you,I found your email on one of my clients 
file and that's why I decided to contact you.
 
Are you willing and ready to assist in this transaction? We shall 
both benefit financially.
 
Awaiting response,
 
Bar. Peter Mantle</pre></div></div>
